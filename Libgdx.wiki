==Basic Transformation Overview (OpenGL)==
A big part of graphics are coordinate transformations.  In a 2D context, you have (0,0) at the top left, and (width-1,height-1) at the bottom right.  You can change this coordinate frame using transformations as an efficient way to move a lot of things around, or to create the effect of a moving camera.

Basic transform functions:
  * *glLoadIdentity* resets back to normal
  * *glTranslate*
  * *glScale*
  * *glRotate*

===Example===
If you want to move the camera down, you would translate the coordinate frame up by calling glTranslatef(0,-10,0);  Now, your (0,0) is 10 pixels higher, and everything drawn afterwards will be higher on the screen.
