==Cloning the Repository==
  # Delete your local copy of the code from your workspace
  # Install the plugin in Eclipse
  # File... New Project
  # Mercurial > Clone Existing
  # Input the URL found in the "Source" section of this site
  # Input your email, and the password found in the "Source" section of this site
  
==Committing Changes==
Everyone who clones the repository has a local copy of the entire history of the project on their computer.  So when you select the command to *commit* your changes, you're only updating your _local_ copy of the repository.  To update the googlecode repository, first *commit* the changes, then select the *push* command.

  # Right click project > Team
  # Select commit to commit the changed files to your local repo
  # Select push to push your local repo to google code

==Misc Notes==
  * Make sure to use the HTTPS url when pushing updates, or else you get a 403 Forbidden error
  * Make sure to use the special password found in the "Source" section of this site, not your gmail password
  * The long hex number after the project name in the workspace is the SHA-1 hash generated based on the content of the current branch.  The idea is that it will be unique for each step in the project.
